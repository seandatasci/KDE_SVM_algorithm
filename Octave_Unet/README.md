With a few fixes from their paper to achieve better performance:  
    1) Deeper network with more parameters    
    2) Added dropout only in deepest layer  
    3) Utilizing rectified ADAM optimizer  
    4) Octave transposed Hâ†’L kernels first apply vanilla transposed convolution and then downsample output by   
    a scale of two, which better follows the rigor of the orginal octave convolution paper
