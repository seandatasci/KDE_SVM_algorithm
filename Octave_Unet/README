With a few fixes from their paper to achieve better performance:
    1) Deeper network with more parameters
    2) Added dropout only in deepest layer
    3) Utilizing rectified ADAM optimizer
    4) Hâ†’L kernels first apply vanilla transposed convolution and then downsample output by a scale of two.
       Which better follows the rigor of the orginal octave convolution paper.
